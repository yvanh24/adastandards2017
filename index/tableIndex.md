#### Link: 

Number | Recommendation | Link
------ | -------------- | ----
1	| FPG >=126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.*
2	| 2-h PG >=200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT. The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.*
3	| A1C >=6.5% (48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay.*
4	| In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose >=200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)

15 | Testing should be considered in all adults who are overweight (BMI >=25 kg/m2 or >=23 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) and A1C >=5.7% (39 mmol/mol), IGT, or IFG on previous testing
16 | "Testing should be considered in all adults who are overweight (BMI >=25 kg/m2 or >=23 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) and other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans)"
17 | Testing should be considered in all adults who are overweight (BMI >=25 kg/m2 or >=23 kg/m2 in Asian Americans) and history of CVD
18 | For all patients, testing should begin at age 45 years
19 | If results are normal, testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results (e.g., those with prediabetes should be tested yearly) and risk status.
